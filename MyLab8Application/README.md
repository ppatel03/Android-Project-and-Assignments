Task 1 (90 points): Modify the RecyclerView fragment that you wrote in the past, do the following:
 (30 points) Load your movie data from this URL:
http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/Teaching/android/Labs/json/movie.json. This json file contains an array of json objects.
 (30 points) Each movie entry from the above json file has a field called “url”, which is where you should download the picture for the movies. You can’t use any local image; all the movie images must be downloaded from the Internet.
 (30 points) When a movie is selected, the detail fragment should be loaded, which displayd the details of the movie, including its name, description, year, length, stars, directors, rating, and images (you can reuse the fragment that you built in the past homework). The details of the movie are not included in the above json file; instead, you need to fetch the details from our web site. The above json file (movie.json) includes a field called “id”. If the value of this field is “titanic”, then the url for the detail json file is http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/Teaching/android/Labs/json/titanic.json. This json file contains a single json object.
It should be noted, during our grading, we will change the contents of those json files (the field names will be the same), so if you use any local information or image, you will be immediately caught, and thus receive zero point for this task. Moreover, you can’t block your UI. If your UI is blocked, you receive zero point for this task.
